#xlsxwriter is the module that can create an excel file for us to export to
#I just looked up a YouTube video on how to use it so the results here may be ugly but it is a start

#I want to pull that info into a list of dictionaries and since ret is formatted as a list, the dictionary should populate
#This could fail, I have not worked with dictionaries since I first started learning python and I did not consult any resources when I wrote this
